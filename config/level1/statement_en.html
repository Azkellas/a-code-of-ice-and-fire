                <p>The map is a grid of size 12x12, where the top-left corner is the case <const>(0,0)</const>. The map is randomly generated at the start of each game.</p>
                <p>
                    A map cell can be either

                        <li> void: it is not a playable cell (like a hole or a wall).</li>
                        <li> neutral: the cell belongs to no player and is colored in grey.</li>
                        <li> captured: the cell belongs to a player and is of the color of the owner.<img src="http://file.azke.fr/tuile_red02.png" style="height:20px;"/> <img src="http://file.azke.fr/tuile_blue02.png" style="height:20px;"/></li>
                        <li> inactive: the cell used to belong to a player but is not connected to this player's territory (see next section). <img src="http://file.azke.fr/tuile_red01.png" style="height:20px;"/> <img src="http://file.azke.fr/tuile_blue01.png" style="height:20px;"/></li>

                <p><strong>Territory ownership</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Along the game, each player will capture cells to enlarge their territory. A player territory is composed of all the cells owned by the player that are <strong>active</strong>. A cell is said to be <strong>active</strong> if and only if the cell is connected to the headquarters. That is, there exists a path from the headquarters to this cell.

                    <figcaption>Red's territory is composed of 6 cells. The 3 red-dark are cells they used to control but Blue player interrupted part of this territory. They are thus inactive. By capturing for example the cell marked by an X, Red can make these cells active again.</figcaption>

                <br/>
                <p><strong>Buildings</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Players cannot build buildings in this league.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You start the game with one important building. This is the <img src="http://file.azke.fr/forteresse_red.png" style="height:20px;"/> <strong>headquarters</strong>. A player has to protect their own headquarters while trying to destroy opponent's one. Losing their headquarters results to a lost game.<br/>
                    <br/>
                </p>






                <br/>
                <p><strong>Income</strong></p>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of each turn, a player gain or lose gold based on their income. A player has <const>+1</const> income for each <strong>active</strong> cell owned and <const>+4</const> income for each mine in possession.<br/>

                    Players will have to build units to capture opponent's headquarters. These units cost income (upkeep).
                    <ul>
                        <li>Level <const>1</const> units reduce income by <const>1</const>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    If a player cannot pay their upkeep, all player's units die and the player has <const>0</const> gold for this turn.
                </p>

                <br/>
                <p><strong>Armies</strong></p>
                <p>
                    To destroy opponent's headquarters, a player has to train armies. Armies are used to capture cells and destroy opponent's buildings and units. <br/>

                    There are <const>3</const> levels of units and the higher the level, the stronger the unit is.<!-- BEGIN level1 --> However, in this league, there is only access to level 1 units.<!-- END --> When a player unit walks on a cell not owned by this player, the cell is <strong>captured</strong>. Also, when a player unit walks on a cell where another enemy unit is, the enemy unit is instantly killed (without harm to the player unit).
                    <ul>
                        <li>Level <const>1</const> units can move on empty cells or opponent headquarters. In this league <strong>only</strong>, they can also kill level 1 units.</li>
                        


                    </ul>

                    If an unit is on an unactive (i.e. not active) cell at the beginning of a turn, the unit is instantly killed.




                    <ul>
                        <li>Each unit can be moved once each turn. Units move only <const>1</const> cell away from their current position, using the command <action>MOVE id x y</action>.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The target cell must be free or capturable.</li>
                            <li>If the distance between the unit and the target coordinates x and y is greater than 1, pathfinding is done to get the unit closer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Players can train armies using the <action>TRAIN level x y</action> action. They can be only trained on cells in player's territory or its direct neighbourhood (border). Armies training follows the same rules as moving: no training can be done on a cell occupied by a friendly unit/building, and the unit must be powerful enough to be trained on a cell occupied by an enemy.</li>
                        <li>All actions are processed sequentially and the game state is recomputed after each one: an action not possible at the beginning of the turn might be done later in the same turn.</li>
