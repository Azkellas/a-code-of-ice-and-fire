      Each player control a faction, starting from an edge of a grid-map.<br/>
      Build armies to defeat your opponent by destroying their headquarters.<br/>

      <p>This is a strategic turn-based game.</p>
      Each turn, you can:<br/>
      move units<br/>
      train units (with a level, 1, 2 or 3)<br/>
      build something: a mine (that produces more gold), or a tower (that protects nearby cells)<br/>
      You capture a cell if you walk on it<br/>
      Each turn, you gain 1 gold per owned cell and 4 per owned mine<br/>
      You only control/own cells that are connected to your HQ<br/>
      fight: to kill a unit, yours must be of higher level, or at max level (2 kill 1, 3 kill 3 and 2 and 1, 1 kills nothing)<br/>
      to kill towers and neighbour cell (4-connex), your unit must be 2 or 3<br/>
      <br/>
      Each action is performed sequentially<br/>

          <p><strong>The map</strong></p>
          <p>
          <p>The map is a grid of size 12x12, where the top-left corner is the case <const>(0,0)</const>.</p>
          <p>
            A cell can be either
            <ul>
              <li> void: it is not a playable cell (like a hole or a wall).</li>
              <li> neutral: the cell belongs to no player and is colored in grey.</li>
              <li> captured: the cell belongs to a player and is of the color of the owner.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p><strong>Territory ownership</strong></p>
          <p>
              Along the game, each player will capture cells to enlarge their territory. A player territory is composed of all the cells owned by the player that are <strong>active</strong>. A cell is said to be <strong>active</strong> if and only if the cell is connected to the headquarters. That is, there exists a path from the headquarters to this cell.
          </p>

              <img src="https://i.imgur.com/udipGqA.png" alt="territory-ownership" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:350px;" /><br/>
              <figcaption>Red's territory is composed of 6 cells. The 4 pink cells are cells they used to control but Green player interrupted part of this territory. They are thus inactive. By capturing the cell marked by an X, Red can make the pink cells active again.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <br/>
          <p><strong>Buildings</strong></p>
          <p>
              There are 2 differents buildings that can be built:
              <ul>
                <li><action>MINE</action>: mines product gold each turn and are the main source of income. A mine costs (10 + 2*<var>nbMines</var>) to build. So the first costs 10, the second one 12, and so on and so forth. Mines income is always <const>+4</const>.</li>
                <li><action>TOWER</action>: towers protect nearby owned cells (up, down, left and right). Cells protected by a tower can only be reached by units of level <const>3</const>. Likewise, the tower can only be destroyed by a level <const>3</const> unit. A tower costs 15 gold to build.</li>
              </ul>
              Another building is the <strong>headquarters</strong>. A player has to protect their own headquarters while trying to destroy opponent's one. Losing their headquarters results to a lost game.<br/>

              A player can only build on owned active cells.
              <br/>
          </p>

          <br/>
          <p><strong>Income</strong></p>
          <p>
              At the beginning of each turn, a player gain or lose gold based on their income. A player has <const>+1</const> income for each <strong>active</strong> cell owned and <const>+4</const> income for each mine in possession.<br/>

              Players will have to build units to capture opponent's headquarters. These units cost income (upkeep).
              <ul>
                  <li>Level <const>1</const> units reduce income by <const>1</const>.</li>
                  <li>Level <const>2</const> units reduce income by <const>4</const>.</li>
                  <li>Level <const>3</const> units reduce income by <const>20</const>.</li>
              </ul>
              If a player cannot pay their upkeep, all player's units die and the player has <const>0</const> gold for this turn.
          </p>

          <br/>
          <p><strong>Armies</strong></p>
          <p>
              To destroy opponent's headquarters, a player has to train armies. Armies are used to capture cells and destroy opponent's buildings and units. <br/>

              There are <const>3</const> levels of units and the higher the level, the stronger the unit is. When a player unit walks on a cell not owned by this player, the cell is <strong>captured</strong>. Also, when a player unit walks on a cell where another enemy unit is, the enemy unit is instantly killed (without harm to the player unit).
              <ul>
                <li>Level <const>1</const> units can only move on empty cells, mines or headquarters.</li>
                <li>Level <const>2</const> units, in addition, can kill level <const>1</const> units.</li>
                <li>Level <const>3</const> units, besides, can kill any units or buildings.</li>
            </ul>

            If an unit is on an unactive (i.e. not active) cell at the beginning of a turn, the unit is instantly killed.

            Here is a table summary for each units, including their recruitment cost and their impact on income (upkeep):

            <table style="text-align:center; width: 100%; border-spacing: 10px; border-collapse: separate;">

            </table>



            <ul>
                <li>Each unit can be moved once each turn. Units can only move to a neighbour cell (up, down, left, right).</li>
                <li>Players can train armies using the <action>TRAIN level x y</action> action. They can be only trained on cells in player's territory or its direct neighbourhood (border). Armies training follows the same rules as moving: no training can be done on a cell occupied by a friendly unit/building, and the unit must be powerful enough to be trained on a cell occupied by an enemy.</li>
                <li>All actions are processed sequentially and the game state is recomputed after each one: an action not possible at the beginning of the turn might be done later in the same turn.</li>
